# Clean Me Exercise

Please take a look at clean-me.php

We'd like you to spend some time going through this code and refactoring it. The code is functional, but can definietely be improved upon. 

To complete the exercise, please fork this repository and work in your fork. Once you've completed your rework create a Pull Request back to this repository so we can view the diff.   

You are at liberty to do as much refactoring as you see fit, we only ask that you don't include any frameworks or dependancies via composer. There should be no reason to do that. 


Good luck!
